## The generations as changed.

 We should throw away old codes.

### We will not support these.

 * Mobile Phone.

## The NewWorld is a new world.

 * Intuitive file structure

### Intuitive file structure

 You will not hesitate.

### Html path through

 HTML file does not need a controller (endpoint).
 Of course it will be layout.

## Developers friendly

 Very easy to develop.

## Codeing Rule

 1. We not use version numbering.<br/>
    We have adopted rolling update for more than 10 years.
 1. We do not follow the strict English grammar.<br/>
    For example, articles and plurals.
 1. Private method names begin with an underscore.<br/>
    It is because does not get in the way with input completion.
 1. We use tabs at the beginning of the line.<br/>
    It will not collapse at the beginning of the line.
